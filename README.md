Some code I OCR'ed from this programming book.
I made a half-hearted attempt at cleaning it up.

It's a small BASIC extension for a few graphics commands.
You can assemble routines.asm into routines.prg,
load it in an emulator,
convert diagonaalweb.bas to a prg,
load it too,
then run it to get a nice pattern on your screen.
